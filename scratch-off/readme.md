You are a creative frontend developer. Your task is to build an interactive "scratch-to-reveal" web component using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Requirements:

1. Structure: The component should have two layers: a top layer (an opaque color or an image) and a bottom layer underneath (containing a hidden message or image, like "You Won! ðŸŽ‰").

2. Interaction: When the user clicks and drags their mouse over the top layer, it should be "scratched away," revealing the content of the bottom layer underneath the cursor's path.

3. Completion: The component doesn't need to detect when it's fully "scratched." The core focus is on the scratching interaction itself.

4. Technology: The implementation must be self-contained in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The choice between using the HTML Canvas API or modern CSS techniques (like masking) is up to you.

Please provide the complete, working code in a single HTML file.
