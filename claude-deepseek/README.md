A comparison of Galaxy implementations generated by Claude-3.7 and DeepSeek-R1.

## Prompt

### Claude-3.7

Create a single `claude.html` file that displays an animated space scene featuring:

A rotating galaxy in the center, with spiral arms made of twinkling stars.
Several orbiting planets around the galaxy, each with its own speed and orbit radius.
Occasional shooting stars that streak across the screen.
A subtle, animated starfield background to give depth and realism.
Use a dark theme with neon or glowing elements for a cosmic vibe.
All animations must be smooth, continuous, and loop naturally.
Use only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a single file — no external libraries or images allowed.
Keep the code clean, readable, and well-organized within the HTML file.
