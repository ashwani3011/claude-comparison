Build a Confetti Celebration for Milestone Completion
Create a small interactive component that tracks the completion of tasks or steps.

The user can mark tasks as done (e.g., checkboxes or buttons)

When all tasks are completed, trigger a confetti animation celebrating the milestone

If any task is undone, the confetti disappears

The confetti effect should be smooth and visually appealing, suitable to plug into any web app

Implement using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in one file

Include inline comments explaining the confetti trigger and how the component tracks progress

This component should be easily adaptable to celebrate any milestone or goal completion in a web app â€” from onboarding flows to quizzes, purchases, or project steps.
