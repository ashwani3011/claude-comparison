Create an interactive password field with an animated monkey character that reacts to password strength. The monkey should:

Cover its eyes when the user is typing in the password field
Peek through fingers when the field is empty
Show different reactions based on password strength:

Weak password: Look worried/scared
Medium password: Show cautious approval
Strong password: Display excitement/happiness

Please implement this using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a single file. The animation should be smooth, and the password strength should be evaluated in real-time as the user types. Make the design visually appealing and include comments in the code to explain the key components.
