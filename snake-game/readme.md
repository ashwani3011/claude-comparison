Build the classic Snake game using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

Game must include:

* A snake that moves on a grid and is controlled by the arrow keys.
* Randomly appearing "food" for the snake to eat.
* When the snake eats, it grows longer and the score increases.
* The game ends if the snake hits a wall or its own body.
* A visible score display, a "Game Over" message, and a "Restart" button.

Optional flair:

* Smooth animations or fun visual styling
* Sound effects for eating or game over
* Theming (retro pixel art, neon grid, emojis, etc.)

Create a single HTML file containing all code.
