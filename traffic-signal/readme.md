Create a traffic signal simulation using only **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript** (in a single `.html` file).

**Core Requirements:**
✅ A vertical traffic light with 3 lights: Red, Yellow, and Green 
✅ Lights should change automatically in the following order: Red → Green → Yellow → Red... 
✅ Each light stays active for a specific duration (e.g. Red: 4s, Green: 3s, Yellow: 1s) 
✅ Display the current active light clearly (only one should be "on" at a time) 

**Bonus Flair (Optional):**
✨ Smooth light transitions using CSS animations or effects 
✨ Add a countdown timer for each light 
✨ Allow users to start/stop the simulation with buttons
