## Prompt

### Claude 3.5

Create a single `claude-3.5.html` file that includes all the required HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display three animated weather cards. Each card should clearly represent one of the following weather conditions with smooth, continuous animations:

Cold – light falling snowflakes, cool blue tones, and a chilly atmosphere
Rain – falling raindrops, small puddles forming, and gray clouds
Sun – a bright sun with rotating rays and a warm, glowing background

All three weather cards should be displayed side by side on the page.
Make sure the animations are clearly visible, smooth, and continuously loop to create a lively effect.
All styles and scripts must be included inline within the same HTML file—no external files.
